Simple Chatbot with Transformers
This project is a basic conversational chatbot designed to simulate simple human-like interactions. Built as a milestone project to practice machine learning techniques, this chatbot leverages a transformer-based model with attention mechanisms to generate responses. It is trained on the Cornell Movie Dialogues dataset, which provides a diverse array of conversational data from movie scripts, helping the chatbot produce more natural responses.

Project Structure
- chat.py: Manages user interaction and chatbot responses.
- preprocessing.py: Prepares the dataset by cleaning and tokenizing the text.
- training.py: Contains the training pipeline for the transformer model.
- model.py: Defines the transformer architecture used for response generation.
- config.py: Configuration file for model parameters, data paths, etc.
